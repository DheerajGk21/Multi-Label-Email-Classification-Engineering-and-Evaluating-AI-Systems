# Introduction

The project implements a Chained Multi-Output Architecture for multiple label email classification on top of the Single Output Architecture that was provided. The new architecture will predict messages tone and resolution thus expanding the single architecture functionality that predicted only intent. The Multi Output model is designed and implemented to ensure modularity and scalability by choosing a pipeline chain.
